A mix of simulation and abstract building and thinking. Since the game as a whole incorporate multiple areas of gaming, the main focus of the games is to provide a calming experience in VR/AR. The game should be used as a reinforcer and also informative tool for the general population.

The background for the theme of the game comes from the mental health field. Virtual Reality Therapy or commonly known as VRT, is starting to become a new type therapy for some mental illnesses treatment. Polygonia is a game that will be catered to the mental illness demographic but eventually can lead into something that the general population can use. 
The main theme of the game will be divided into four parts:
The first level are mainly for therapists trainees (training simulator). The VR device will be designed to train an entry level therapist who is not familiar with ABA and treatment procedures. The simulation will be in a classroom and home setting. 1:1.
Therapists will be trained on what ABA (applied behavior analysis) treatment looks like.


```javascript

if (Input.GetButton ("Fire1") && MostRecent ) {

			MostRecent.transform.Rotate (new Vector3 (x, y, z) * Time.deltaTime);
            MostRecent.transform.localScale += Vector3.one * growthScaler * maxsize * Time.deltaTime * Mathf.Sin (Time.frameCount/growthslowness);
            	}

```

 The second is  the mid-higher end level are for professionals. This will be a training simulator that collects data and cross references with other children. I want to create a simulation that trains and also tracks the behavior patterns of real data from children with autism. 

The third level is a device that is for more of a professional standard. The simulator will have more functions in regards to data collection and analysis. After the training is completed, the program will tell the player how a clinician would choose the treatment plan for the child they are treating.

The last part of overall game is for kids- children that have autism (higher functioning mainly). The game will also track and record for the mid level professionals to see any trends. This is be the first part of the iteration. This will be a first person perspective view. 

Main section of game to be completed would be the last part of the game, which is the  puzzle/builder game. There will be a virtual space where the player can go into a world and start building off the the shapes they are given. The environment will be a peaceful setting where the colors and music are all calming elements for the player.
